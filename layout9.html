			<h3>The First Balloon Ascent in England</h3>
			<div class="wrapper">
				<p>Following his own account, Lunardi's first act on finding himself fairly above the town was
					to fortify himself with some glasses of wine, and to devour the leg of a chicken. He describes
					the city as a vast beehive, St. Paul's and other churches standing out prominently; the streets
					shrunk to lines, and all humanity apparently transfixed and watching him. A little later he is
					equally struck with the view of the open country, and his ecstasy is pardonable in a novice. The
					verdant pastures eclipsed the visions of his own lands. The precision of boundaries impressed
					him with a sense of law and order, and of good administration in the country where he was a
					sojourner.</p>
				<p>By this time he found his balloon, which had been only two-thirds full at starting, to be
					so distended that he was obliged to untie the mouth to release the strain. He also found that
					the condensed moisture round the neck had frozen. These two statements point to his having
					reached a considerable altitude, which is intelligible enough. It is, however, difficult to
					believe his further assertion that by the use of his single oar he succeeded in working himself
					down to within a few hundred feet of the earth. The descent of the balloon must, in point of
					fact, have been due to a copious outrush of gas at his former altitude. Had his oar really been
					effective in working the balloon down it would not have needed the discharge of ballast
					presently spoken of to cause it to reascend. Anyhow, he found himself sufficiently near the
					earth to land a passenger who was anxious to get out. His cat had not been comfortable in the
					cold upper regions, and now at its urgent appeal was deposited in a corn field, which was the
					point of first contact with the earth. It was carefully received by a country-woman, who
					promptly sold it to a gentleman on the other side of the hedge, who had been pursuing the
					balloon.</p>
