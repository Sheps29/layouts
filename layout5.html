            <div>
                <aside class="left">
                    <p>At the office of The Morning Advertiser, I am informed by my old friend Mr. Charles Williams,
                        they boast of a race of cats bred there for nearly half a century. In colour these are mostly
                        tortoiseshell, and some are very handsome.</p>
                </aside>
                <main>
                    <p>In our urban and suburban houses what should we do without cats? In our sitting or bedrooms, our
                        libraries, in our kitchens and storerooms, our farms, barns, and rickyards, in our docks, our
                        granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other places too
                        numerous to mention, how useful they are! In our ships, however, the rats oft set them at
                        defiance; still they are of great service.</p>
                    <p>How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice, awaiting their egress from
                        their place of refuge or that which is their home! How well Shakespeare in Pericles, Act iii.,
                        describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural pursuit!</p>
                </main>
                <aside>
                    <p>Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as I once had, and let them be delivered therefrom by
                        cats, as I was, and they will have a lasting and kind regard for them.</p>
